# passwordGenerator
This project required starter code to be modified to create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected.
The app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. 
It has a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes. 
When the user clicks the button to generate a password, they are presented with a series of prompts for password criteria.
The user select which criteria to include in the password.
The length of password must be at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters.
The password can contain combinations of the following character types: special, numeric, lowercase and/or uppercase. 
When the user answers each prompt the chosen input is validated.
At least one character type must be selected 
When all prompts are answered, a password is generated that matches the selected criteria.
When the password is generated it is written to the page.

The completed application can be viewed here: https://lallender.github.io/passwordGenerator/

The application will appear like this in the web browser:
